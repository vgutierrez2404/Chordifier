## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [List other required software, e.g., CUDA for GPU support]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    cd yourproject
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. Place your raw audio files in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script to process the raw audio files:
    ```sh
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    ```

### Training the Model

1. Run the training script:
    ```sh
    python src/train.py
    ```

### Running Inference

1. Run the inference script to make predictions on new audio files:
    ```sh
    python src/inference.py
    ```
